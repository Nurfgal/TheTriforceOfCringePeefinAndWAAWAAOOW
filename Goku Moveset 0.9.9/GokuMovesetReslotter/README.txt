----------General Notes-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use this only if you for whatever reason have ryu mods over c100-c107.

This tool is used to reslott goku on any other cXX with a few clicks.

Dont move the tool and its folder outside of the mods root folder or it wont work properly.
					
Just select the new costume slots you want the goku moveset over.
you can put it over any added ryu slot and the moveset will only apply to the selected slots.
